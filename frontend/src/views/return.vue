    <h1>Return & Refund Policy</h1>
    <p>ProConnect facilitates services provided by independent contractors. Since services cannot be physically returned, our return policy works as follows:</p>

    <h2>1. Service Disputes</h2>
    <p>If you are dissatisfied with a contractorâ€™s service, you may submit a dispute within 7 days of completion. ProConnect will review the case and mediate where possible.</p>

    <h2>2. Refunds</h2>
    <p>Refunds may be granted only if services were not delivered, were misrepresented, or if there was a breach of agreement by the contractor.</p>

    <h2>3. Non-Refundable Cases</h2>
    <p>Refunds will not be issued for dissatisfaction due to subjective preferences if the service was delivered as agreed.</p>

    <h2>4. Resolution Process</h2>
    <p>All refund requests are handled on a case-by-case basis. Our decision is final after reviewing evidence from both parties.</p>
